## Basic Switch and End Device Configuration (Packet Tracer)

I completed a basic networking lab in Cisco Packet Tracer where I configured two switches and two PCs in a small LAN topology.

First, I performed the physical setup by placing the switches in the rack and the PCs on the table, and I connected the devices using the correct cable types — a copper cross-over cable between the two switches and copper straight-through cables between each PC and its switch.

Then I configured the IP addressing plan based on the lab table, assigning IP addresses to PC-A, PC-B, and the VLAN 1 interfaces of switches S1 and S2.

After that, I accessed each switch using a console connection and configured the hostname, console password, enable secret, MOTD banner, and the VLAN 1 management IP address.

Finally, I verified connectivity using ping between PCs and switches. All tests were successful, and the Packet Tracer assessment showed 100% completion.

This lab demonstrates basic racking, cabling, IP addressing, and initial switch configuration in a small LAN.
